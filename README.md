# What is it 
 This is a starting point to develop a more complete API in NodeJS.
 There are already differents folders that contains routes, middlewares, auth, dbConfig, models and utils.
 There's also a user table with JWT so that users can login.
 If you need to see the routes, a swagger is available at /api-docs.
